# Task-05: Neural Style Transfer


###📌 Objective

The objective of this task is to apply the **artistic style of one image** (style image) to the **content of another image** (content image) using **Neural Style Transfer (NST)** with a pre-trained deep learning model.


###🧠 Concept Used

Neural Style Transfer works by:
- Preserving the **content features** of one image
- Applying the **style features** (colors, textures, brush strokes) of another image
- Optimizing a generated image using **content loss** and **style loss**



### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- PyTorch  
- Google Colab  
- Pre-trained VGG19 Model  
- PIL & Matplotlib  



# 📂 Files Included

### ▶️ Execution Steps

1. Upload the content and style images
2. Load the VGG19 pre-trained model
3. Extract content and style features
4. Calculate content loss and style loss
5. Optimize the generated image
6. Display the final stylized output



### 🖼️ Output

The final stylized image successfully combines:
- The **structure and objects** from the content image
- The **artistic appearance** from the style image

📌 **Note:**  
Due to GitHub rendering limitations, the **generated outputs are best viewed in the Google Colab notebook**:

👉 **`task5.ipynb` (Colab Notebook)**

All outputs, visualizations, and results are properly displayed and executed inside the Colab environment.


### ✅ Result
The Neural Style Transfer model successfully generates a stylized image demonstrating the practical application of Generative AI concepts.


### 🔚 Conclusion
This task demonstrates the use of deep learning models for creative image transformation and highlights the practical implementation of Neural Style Transfer using PyTorch.
