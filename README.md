# Task-05: Neural Style Transfer


###📌 Objective

The objective of this task is to apply the **artistic style of one image** (style image) to the **content of another image** (content image) using **Neural Style Transfer (NST)** with a pre-trained deep learning model.


###🧠 Concept Used

Neural Style Transfer works by:
- Preserving the **content features** of one image
- Applying the **style features** (colors, textures, brush strokes) of another image
- Optimizing a generated image using **content loss** and **style loss**



### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- PyTorch  
- Google Colab  
- Pre-trained VGG19 Model  
- PIL & Matplotlib  



# 📂 Files Included

### ▶️ Execution Steps

1. Upload the content and style images.
2. '![style](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51fc121b-0def-49f0-b5a8-045f300738fd)
   and![content](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1fe5bdc-ec5c-411a-a65f-c3692b9df3b6)
3. Upload `prodigytask5.ipynb` **OR** can oprn using githubnotebook URL.
4. Load the VGG19 pre-trained model
5. Extract content and style features
6. Calculate content loss and style loss
7. Optimize the generated image
8. Display the final stylized output



### 🖼️ Output

The final stylized image successfully combines:
- The **structure and objects** from the content image
- The **artistic appearance** from the style image

📌 **Note:**  
Due to GitHub rendering limitations, the **generated outputs are best viewed in the Google Colab notebook**:

👉 **`task5.ipynb` (Colab Notebook)**

All outputs, visualizations, and results are properly displayed and executed inside the Colab environment.


### ✅ Result
The Neural Style Transfer model successfully generates a stylized image demonstrating the practical application of Generative AI concepts.


### 🔚 Conclusion
This task demonstrates the use of deep learning models for creative image transformation and highlights the practical implementation of Neural Style Transfer using PyTorch.
